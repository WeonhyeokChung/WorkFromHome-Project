# WorkFromHome-Project
Studying heterogeneity of work from home policy.

I use causal random forest. I borrowed codes from Athey, Susan and Stefan Wager. Estimating Treatment Effects with Causal Forests: An Application. Observational Studies, 5, 2019.

I find that the above median productivity worse off while those below median better off after the policy. You can find my results from the following link: https://github.com/WeonhyeokChung/WorkFromHome-Project/blob/main/Weonhyeok_WFH.pdf

For the R codes, please check out the following link: https://github.com/WeonhyeokChung/WorkFromHome-Project/blob/main/WFH.R

For the data, I use existing data from the following paper: Does working from home work? Evidence from a Chinese experiment (with James Liang, John Roberts and Zhichun Jenny Ying) Quarterly Journal of Economics, February 2015.
